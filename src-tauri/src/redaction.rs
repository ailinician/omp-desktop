//! Credential key list and key matcher shared by every redaction path: the
//! agent stdout reader (`agent::reader`, structured JSON frames) and the
//! widget error text scanner (`widgets::redact`, free text). One list, one
//! matcher, so the two paths cannot drift apart.

/// Object keys whose values are redacted before a frame ever reaches the
/// webview. Matched case-insensitively after stripping `_`/`-` separators,
/// so `Authorization`, `api_key`, `api-key`, and `apiKey` are all caught by
/// one entry. Matching is by *suffix*, not exact equality, so compound
/// provider-credential spellings like `x-api-key`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and
/// `client_secret` (normalizing to `xapikey`, `openaiapikey`, and
/// `clientsecret`) are caught by the `apikey`/`secret` entries without
/// needing one entry per provider. A few spellings put the sensitive word
/// anywhere but the suffix (`secretkey`, `accesskey`, `privatekey`,
/// `apisecret`) — those get their own explicit entries. `headers` is
/// redacted wholesale (not walked) because a model provider's request
/// headers routinely carry `Authorization` alongside harmless entries, and
/// there is no benefit to preserving the harmless ones once the object as
/// a whole must be treated as sensitive.
