//! Process-tree supervision, shared by everything that spawns: omp
//! (`agent/`), widget plugins, the terminal's shell on Windows and the
//! browser's Chromium; plus the pid probes (`pid_is_alive`,
//! `kill_group_if_leader`) the JSON store's lock takeover and the browser's
//! orphan reaper use.
//!
//! `Child::kill` only signals the direct child process. omp forks subagents
//! and shells out to tools (bash, etc.); killing just the top-level `omp`
//! process leaves those descendants running, reparented to init/orphaned —
//! a stopped or crashed session can leak an unbounded number of live
//! processes. Two platform primitives close that gap:
//!
//! - **Unix**: the child is made the leader of its own process group
//!   (`process_group(0)`, stable since Rust 1.64) *before* spawn, and
//!   `SIGKILL` is sent to the whole group (`kill(-pgid, SIGKILL)`) on
//!   teardown — every descendant that hasn't changed its own group dies
//!   with it.
//! - **Windows**: the child is assigned to a Job Object configured with
//!   `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` *after* spawn. Closing the last
//!   handle to that job (whether via an explicit call or `Drop`) kills
//!   every process ever assigned to it, including grandchildren spawned
//!   after assignment.
//!
//! Usage: call [`ProcessSupervisor::prepare`] on the `Command` before
//! `.spawn()`, then [`ProcessSupervisor::attach`] on the resulting `Child`
//! after `.spawn()`. Dropping the returned supervisor — or calling
//! [`ProcessSupervisor::kill_tree`] explicitly — kills the whole tree.
//! Both steps store only a pid or a raw job handle in an atomic, so
//! `ProcessSupervisor` is `Send` with no unsafe impl required. On Windows
//! the terminal (`terminal/kill.rs`) uses `ProcessSupervisor::attach_process`
//! for its `portable-pty` shell, so the job setup exists once.
