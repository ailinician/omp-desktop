//! Verified copies of the files a plugin's fingerprint hashes, so a run
//! executes the bytes its approval check saw. Checking the files and then
//! starting the plugin by their paths leaves a window in which a script can
//! be swapped; instead a run gets an argv naming copies whose bytes were
//! compared with, or copied from, the bytes hashed to the approved
//! fingerprint in this same pass.
//!
//! Layout under `<app cache>/widget-runs/`, private to the user (`0700` dirs
//! on unix):
//! - `store/<fingerprint>/<argv index>/<file name>`: the copies of one
//!   approved fingerprint, reused by every run while it stays approved, so a
//!   tool that keys a cache by script path (uv's per-script environments)
//!   sees one stable path. Reuse is never on trust: each stored copy is
//!   compared with its original chunk by chunk while the original is hashed,
//!   and the entry must be a real directory holding exactly the copies as
//!   real files. If the originals still match the approval but the entry
//!   does not (a copy planted, tampered with or truncated by a crash before
//!   its bytes reached the disk; a module planted beside a copy; a link), the
//!   entry is removed and built again.
//! - `staging/<pid>/<n>/`: copies being built, each file streamed through the
//!   hash and into staging at once. Only if the result equals the approved
//!   fingerprint is the directory renamed into `store/`. If that rename fails
//!   (an entry that could not be removed, a concurrent run that stored first,
//!   a handle an antivirus still holds), this run executes the staging copy,
//!   which is removed when the run ends; an entry this pass did not build or
//!   verify is never used.
//!
//! A run without copies to make creates no directory at all.
//!
//! What is not copied, and so still runs from its own path:
//! - the program itself (`argv[0]`) when it is a native executable of this
//!   platform: on Windows a path ending in `.exe` whose content starts with
//!   `MZ` (Rust neither probes another name for it nor treats it as a batch
//!   file, so `CreateProcess` loads the very file hashed); elsewhere an ELF or
//!   Mach-O header. It finds its libraries next to itself, which are not
//!   fingerprinted anyway. Only the OS loader reads it, so a text script
//!   cannot pass for one: an argument that looks native is still copied;
//! - a file over the fingerprint's 8 MiB limit, pinned only by size + mtime;
//! - anything that is not a regular file when the run starts (a directory, a
//!   missing path), which the fingerprint does not hash.
//!
//! A copy keeps its file name, so an interpreter that dispatches on the
//! extension (`.mjs`, `.ps1`) still does, and on unix its owner-execute bit,
//! so a shebang script still starts. Its directory is not the original's: a
//! script must not load siblings relative to itself.
//!
//! [`ScriptStore::prune`] (at startup) deletes the staging directories of dead
//! processes and the store entries no plugin is approved under.
